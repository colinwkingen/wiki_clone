          M A Krishnadas was the first person to make edaykkya this simple to public and the first to introduce the instrument in the western field of music at a time when it was considered a taboo. He can play the instrument in any genres of music including classical, jazz, pop, western, etc. He is associated with the western troupes like Atma, Kochi and "The Banned", Chennai and has performed in their albums and various stage shows, apart from the humongous number of other classical and non-classical troupes or bands.

          “It might not be off-beamed if I say Tripunithura Krishnadas is the single most Edaykkya player who plays the instrument in the most melodious and heart touching manner of all the players in this world", are the words of Padma Bhushan Dr. K. J. Yesudas who in the early 80s discovered the talent in this gifted artist and mentored him all along. It might not come as a surprise that if the singer is Dr. Yesudas, then the sound of edaykkya will be from Krishnadas.
